        <p>Wait you wanna know about me!? Umm... Er... DEPLOY THE DISTRACTION!</p>

        <p>Wait... YOU MEAN TO TELL THAT DIDN'T WORK!? Dang, I guess now I gotta spend at least two paragraphs talking about myself. Fine. I am Thomas Frobe, but if you ever meet me on the street, it's either Frobe or Mr. Frobe. Nobody calls me Thomas.</p>
        <p>I was born someplace at sometime by some doctor guy. I've spent my whole life wondering from place to place, ever the explorer. I have several hobbies such as video games, making video games, 3d modelling models for my 3d printer, and of course SWU. I guess to sum myself up, I'm a computer expert.</p>
