                <h1>How to play</h1>
                <p><i>Star Wars: Unlimited</i> (SWU) is a really fun game (otherwise I wouldn't be yapping about it). It's similar to <i>Magic the Gathering</i> and <i>HearthStone</i> in that it is a collectable trading card game where you build up a collection of cards and build a deck capable of beating your opponents. Star Wars: Unlimited, however takes some of the concepts of these games and adds new twists that make battles both engaging and enjoyable.</p>

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>If you haven't played either <i>Magic the Gathering</i> or <i>HearthStone</i> or the like, than don't worry - I'll guide you through the basics. In the popular Constructed format, players build a pre-contrstucted deck of cards built around a base and a leader. I also like to bring red, green, and blue dice to help track damage, experience, and shields respectively. You may also wish to have a few copies of token units on hand in case you need them. For your first game, I would recommend that you would purchase one of the pre-built two-player starter decks. They come with decks that are ready to play right out of the gate and include cardboard tokens you can borrow. Starter decks also include cards that you won't find in card packs.</p>
                <h2>Setup</h2>
                <p>Start by randomly deciding who goes first. That player will be the player who holds something called the initive token. Place your leader and base in the center of the play area. Shuffle your deck and draw six cards. If your starting hand sucks, don't worry - you have the option to mulligan your hand. To mulligan, put your hand back in your deck and reshuffle it - drawing six new cards. Just be warned that you can only do this once, and it is entirely possible that you'll get a worse starting hand.</p>

                <h2>Resources and Your First Two</h2>
                <p>Now that you have six cards in hand, you will resource two cards from your hand "ready." To resource a card, place it face down at the bottom of your board. Cards that are resourced are permantly put out of play, but are used to form your mana pool. In other words, you are having to sacrifice cards so you can pay for other cards. There will be an oppertunity to resource more cards later.</p>
                <h2>Action Phase</h2>
                <p>The player holding the initive token is the player who goes first during the action phase. Players have one of five actions available to them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Play a card</li>
                    <li>Attack with a "ready" unit</li>
                    <li>Use a leader/unit/base's action/epic action</li>
                    <li>Take the initive</li>
                    <li>Pass</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once a player has completed an action, play passes to the next player. This continues until the end of the phase.</p>
                <h2>Exhaustion and Readiness</h2>
                <p>Typically, cards can only use their abilities once. To be able to mark a card's readiness for use, cards will either "exhausted" or "ready." In Magic, you may be familiar with the concept of "tapping." The concept is the same in Star Wars: Unlimited. A "ready" card is in an upright position while an "exhausted" card is rotated. All cards and resources (with few exceptions) enter play "exhausted" and typically need to wait until the next turn before you can use them.</p>
                <h3>Play a Card</h3>
                <p>To play a card, you must exhaust a number of ready resources equal to the number printed in the top left corner of the card. There are four types of cards:</p>
                <h4>Ground/Space Units</h4>
                <p>Units form the backbone of your army. Units are capable of both attacking and defending. Units are divided between the space and the ground arenas. When you play a unit, place in its approiprate arena, exhausted.</p>
                <h4>Events</h4>
                <p>Events activate powerful effects that can used to shape the course of battle. Events give a wide variety of effects such as dealing damage, buffing units, or drawing cards. When played, events immediately go into the discard pile.</p>
                <h4>Upgrades</h4>
                <p>Upgrades are played to either buff or nerf units. When played, upgrades must be attached to any unit (enemy units can be targeted by upgrades as well).</p>
                <h3>Combat</h3>
                <p>To attack with a unit, you must declare that you are attacking with target friendly unit. Then, you declare the target of the attack. You may choose any enemy unit within the same arena or the enemy base. You cannot, however, choose to attack a unit of an opposite arena (so ground units cannot interact with space units and space units cannot attack ground units). After the attack is completed, you must exhaust the attacking unit.</p>
                <p>Note: In order to be a valid target for attacking, a unit must be ready. This applies even with abilities that allow you to attack with another unit.</p>
                <h4>Combat: Unit vs Unit</h4>
                <p>Should you choose to attack another unit with your unit, both units will deal damage to each other simaltaniously. To deal damage, add a number of damage counters equal to the unit's power to the other unit. If any unit has an amount of damage equal to or exceeding its HP (or its HP were ever reduced to 0), it is defeated and it and any upgrades are discarded.</p>
                <h4>Combat: Unit vs Base</h4>
                <p>Should you choose to attack the enemy base with your unit, add a number of damage tokens equal to your unit's power to the enemy base.</p>
                <h3>Using an Action Ability</h3>
                <p>If a unit or leader has the ability "Action ([cost]): [Ability]," you may spend your action to activate the effects of that unit/leader's ability. Note: If an acton specifies tapping the unit as a cost of that ability that card must be ready so you can pay the cost of exhausting that card.</p>
                <h2>Ending a Round and Initive</h2>
                <p>Any player has the option to take the initive that round. Once the initive is claimed, no other player may claim it. Taking the initive grants that player the advantage of going first the next round, but comes at the drawback of prematurely ending their action phase. By taking the initive, that player is declaring that they are automatically passing for the rest of the round. The phase will then end once all players consecutively pass. Alternatively, if no player does claim the initive, than play ends with the current initive holder going first next round. Another bit of tech worth noting is that if a player were to pass, than the other is given the oppertunity to take the initive, which also counts as passing for that round, making it possible to prematurely end the phase right there in a two player game.</p>
                <h2>Regroup Phase</h2>
                <p>The end of every round is always marked by a regroup phase. During regroup, you will perform the following actions in order:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Draw two cards</li>
                        <li>Resource up to one card</li>
                        <li>Ready everything on your board</li>
                    </ol>
                <h2>Ending the Game</h2>
                <p>Your objective will be to eliminate all opponents by dealing damage to your opponent's base while defending your own. Once the opponent's base has damage on it equal to its health (usually 30HP), than it will be game over for them. Victory will require you to build an army powerful enough to break through the enemy's defenses (unless you're one of those special Thrawn or Vader decks, but that's a tale for another time).</p>
