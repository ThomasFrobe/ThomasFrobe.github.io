                <h1>Useful Links</h1>
                <p><a href="https://starwarsunlimited.com/how-to-play?chapter=rules">SWU Official Rules Page</a>: On this page is the comprehensive rules guide which states verbatim the exact rules of the game. With there being so many different card effects, questions inevitably come up on how the effects play out, so this is a critical resource that is always worth having downloaded to your phone.</p>
                <p><a href="https://swudb.com/">SWU Database</a>: This page is the one that I always use to build my decks. Star Wars Unlimited Database is extremely useful for visualizing the list of every possible card for your deck. It's also useful for finding other people's deck and easily copying them over to your collection. SWUDB is the accepted way to create deck lists online as even SWU online games like Forcetable, Karabast, and Tabletop Simulator all use SWUDB to import cards.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/star-wars-unlimited/product?productLineName=star-wars-unlimited&view=grid&page=1">TCG Player</a>: Extremely useful website for purchasing sealed products. Oh, and I guess you can buy individual cards or whatever and potentially gain insight on the number one trusted source that every local card shop uses to get a gauge on secondary market card prices, but pffffft, why do that when you can <del>gamble</del> purchase lootboxes!</p>
                <h2>Playing Online</h2>
                <p><a href="">Tabletop Simulator</a>: Software that, well... simulates tabletop games. People have made mods capable of importing decks from SWUDB. It should be noted, however that in order to actually play a game with someone else you have to handle your own rules (just like you would if you were playing in person). While that may seem like a negative, it does at least mean that the game won't suffer from any rule bugs.</p>
                <p>The real drawbacks come from having to actually coordinate with people to actually make the game work. The game will not automatically pair you up with other people. Instead, you will be expected to host or join other people. It also means you will likely be posting "LFG" a lot in the Discord chat rooms. Oh, I also suppose you do have to pay a bit of money for TTS, but trust me when I say it's absolutely worth it if you have friends over the internet or are willing to get together with total strangers.</p>
                <p><a href="">ForceTable</a>: If you need to quickly test out a deck, Forcetable is the perfect place to test decks out until Karabast updates their website. Forcetable is a webapp that allows you to compete against AI opponents.</p>
                <p><a href="https://karabast.net/SWUOnline/MainMenu.php">Karabast</a>: I don't particularly like using TableTop Simulator to play my SWU games mainly because you have to coordinate with other people to get games in. Forcetable only allows you to play against the AI. So, that leaves us with Karabast. Karabast is easily the best way to play SWU games online against other people. It has random matchmaking, and handles all the rules for you, so you don't have to work with other humans. The only downside is that it is a fan-made site. As such, the developers don't have all the time on their hands to work on it, as evidenced by Set 3 not being supported as of writting this paragraph.</p>
