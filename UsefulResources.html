                <h1>Useful Links</h1>
                <p><a href="https://starwarsunlimited.com/how-to-play?chapter=rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SWU Official Rules Page</a>: On this page is the comprehensive rules guide which states verbatim the exact rules of the game. With there being so many different card effects, questions inevitably come up on how the effects play out, so this is a critical resource that is always worth having downloaded to your phone.</p>
                <p><a href="https://swudb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SWU Database</a>: This page is the one that I always use to build my decks. Star Wars Unlimited Database is extremely useful for visualizing the list of every possible card for your deck. It's also useful for finding other people's deck and easily copying them over to your collection. SWUDB is the accepted way to create deck lists online as even SWU online games like <i>Forcetable</i>, <i>Karabast</i>, and <i>Tabletop Simulator</i> mods all use SWUDB to import cards.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/star-wars-unlimited/product?productLineName=star-wars-unlimited&view=grid&page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCG Player</a>: Extremely useful website for purchasing sealed products. Oh, and I guess you can buy individual cards or whatever and potentially gain insight on the number one trusted source that every local card shop uses to get a gauge on secondary market card prices, but pffffft, why do that when you can <del>gamble</del> purchase <del>lootboxes</del> card boxes!</p>
                <h2>Playing Online</h2>
                <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Tabletop Simulator</i> (TTS)</a>: Software that, well... simulates tabletop games. In the <i>Steam</i> Workshop page for TTS, you can lists for hundreds of games, models, and scripts. Additionally, <i>TableTop Simulator</i> allows you play these mods online and with your friends, allowing for game nights even when far away.</p>
                <p>But that's just the game itself. I suppose I should talk about SWU. People have made mods capable of importing decks from SWUDB. It should be noted, however that in order to actually play a game with someone else you have to handle your own rules (just like you would if you were playing in person). While that may seem like a negative, it does at least mean that the game won't suffer from any rule bugs that ForceTable and Karabast sometimes suffer from.</p>
                <p>The real drawbacks come from having to actually coordinate with people to actually make the game work. The game will not automatically pair you up with other people. Instead, you will be expected to host or join other people. This means you will likely be posting "LFG" a lot in <i>Discord</i> chat rooms. Oh, I also suppose you do have to pay a bit of money for TTS, but I assure you that it isn't that much money if you consider how much potential content you'll receive in return.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.forcetable.net/swu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>ForceTable</i></a>: If you need to quickly test out a deck, <i>ForceTable</i> is the perfect place to test decks out really quick. <i>ForceTable</i> is a webapp that allows you to compete against AI opponents.</p>
                <p><a href="https://karabast.net/SWUOnline/MainMenu.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Karabast</i></a>: While I do love TTS, I have to admit that having to coordinate with another player is clunky and doesn't jive well with me. As someone who does not like having to talk to others, <i>Karabast</i> is the perfect solution. <i>Karabast</i> handles matchmaking pretty much for you so you don't have to ask others to play with them. This makes playing with others require less coordination and significantly faster. Additionally, <i>Karabast</i> handles all the rules for you (for the better or the worse), making play even more efficient.</p>
