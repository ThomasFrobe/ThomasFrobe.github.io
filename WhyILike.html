                <h1>Why I Like Star Wars Unlimited</h1>
                <p>If feel like there are a lot of things to like about Star Wars Unlimited. The things I like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Simple card effects:</b> Card effects (at least as of now) are easy and simple to understand.</li>
                    <li><b>The card resourcing system:</b> Something I really dislike about <i>Magic the Gathering</i> is the way you have to get your mana from drawing lands. The issue with that is that I've found myself in too many scenarios where I'm either mana locked or mana flooded. Whenever either scenario happens, I don't feel like I lost because I could have made better plays or my deck was poorly constructed - no, I feel like I lost because I had poor luck which is something you never really want to feel. Granted, is still possible start with a poor draw, but it's much more rare. I also appreciate that resourcing a card requires sacrifice.</li>
                    <li><b>Draw two:</b> Now that I've experienced Star Wars: Unlimited, something I've realized that I dislike about Magic is how slow it can be. Being able to only draw one per turn can really slow down gameplay, especially when you draw an extra land that you didn't need.</li>
                    <li><b>Out of aspect:</b> I really appreciate the fact that being out of aspect doesn't mean you can't play a card, it just means you suffer a resource penalty for being in the wrong aspect. This has allowed for things like Command Bounty Hunter Boba Fett to play Cunning even though he isn't a double Cunning deck.</li>
                    <li><b>One action per turn:</b> Another thing I really appreciate is the fact that players take turns making plays. This does two really good things: 1) It keeps players engaged. 2) It creates an action economy that requires players to carefully consider how they sequence their moves.</li>
                    <li><b>Targeted Attacks:</b> Something I don't like about Magic the Gathering is that it often boils down to a game of footsie. Both players often play defensively because it's punishing to play aggressively. On top of that, if there's a particularly dangerous creature on the opponent's side of the board, you don't have any good way of dealing with it. The only thing you can do is hope that your opponent would try to block your creature with their creature or attack with their creature.</li>
                    <li><b>The fact that it's Star Wars:</b> I've loved Star Wars since I was a kid. I'd play <i>Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast</i>, <i>Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy</i>, <i>Empire At War: Forces of Corruption</i>, <i>Battlefront 2</i>, and <i>Galactic Battlegrounds: Saga</i> all the time. That love only grew after the Disney took over and actually gave Star Wars both focus and a direction. Let me tell you I have very fond memories of coming home from school to play <i>Star Wars: EA Battlefront</i>. If the fact that I actually like the sequels invalidates my opinion, then I apologize for turning you away from a genuinely fun game.</li>
