        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>Hello there, dear viewer! I am Thomas Frobe. I am but a humble servant seeking to find his way in life. So you want to know more about me? Well, when I was four, I was introduced to a computer. Ever since, I've used computers for pretty much all my life. I want to learn more about codding so I can make more of the magic that happens on the screen and make lives better for people.</p>
        <p>Other things I like to do when I'm not working include board games, video games, making video games, and working on Blender projects. I really like 3d modelling because I can actually take those 3d models and put them into the real world through 3d printing, a feat that I otherwise simply could not do. Some of my favorite games include Star Realms and Final Fantasy 7 Remake. I'm also a huge fan of Star Wars (and you can already see how we got here). I've watch pretty much all the shows and have read most of the books out there (thank you Audible for making these car rides more enjoyable).</p>

        <h2>Useful Links</h2>
        <p><a href="https://starwarsunlimited.com/how-to-play?chapter=rules">SWU Official Rules Page</a>: On this page is the comprehensive rules guide which states verbatim the exact rules of the game. With there being so many different card effects, questions inevitably come up on how the effects play out, so this is a critical resource that is always worth having downloaded to your phone.</p>
        <p><a href="https://swudb.com/">SWU Database</a>: This page is the one that I always use to build my decks. Star Wars Unlimited Database is extremely useful for visualizing the list of every possible card for your deck. It's also useful for finding other people's deck and easily copying them over to your collection. SWUDB is the accepted way to create deck lists online as even SWU online games like Forcetable, Karabast, and Tabletop Simulator all use SWUDB to import cards.</p>
        <p><a href="https://karabast.net/SWUOnline/MainMenu.php">Karabast</a>: I don't particularly like using TableTop Simulator to play my SWU games mainly because you have to coordinate with other people to get games in. Forcetable only allows you to play against the AI. So, that leaves us with Karabast. Karabast is easily the best way to play SWU games online against other people. It has random matchmaking, and handles all the rules for you, so you don't have to work with other humans. The only downside is that it is a fan-made site. As such, the developers don't have all the time on their hands to work on it, as evidenced by Set 3 not being supported (CAO: Nov 10th).</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/star-wars-unlimited/product?productLineName=star-wars-unlimited&view=grid&page=1">TCG Player</a>: Extremely useful website for purchasing sealed products. Oh, and I guess you can buy individual cards or whatever and potentially gain insight on the number one trusted source that every local card shop uses to get a gauge on secondary market card prices, but pffffft, why do that when you can <del>gamble</del> purchase lootboxes!</p>
